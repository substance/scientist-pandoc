# Entry Title

Paving the Way to an Open Health Information Knowledgebase


# Summary (250 chars)

Collective use of open software facilitates the creation and exchange of data. Substance would like to introduce this concept to digital publishing in the health domain, enabling consumers to access the most current and accurate content and research.


# Entry Description (10000)

The primary goal of this project is to unite the main contributors to open health-related literature in an effort to improve the quality and availability of scientific publications. By encouraging authors and publishers to use and evolve open software components and a lightweight exchange format usable by web-clients, we reduce the obstacles that originate from economic competition and pave the way to true open publishing and an Open Health Information Knowledgebase. 

With Substance, we would like to contribute an extensive content creation and annotation framework built on web infrastructure. It is designed to be customized and integrated into existing workflows. 

Since 2010, the Substance platform has managed to solve many of the core problems associated with web-based editing tools.  Its features include:

- A JSON-based document model, that can be customized ([Substance.Document](http://interior.substance.io/modules/document.html))
- Support for incremental changes ([Substance.Operator](http://interior.substance.io/modules/operator.html))
- Versioning ([Substance.Chronicle](http://interior.substance.io/modules/chronicle.html))
- A building block for displaying and editing documents ([Substance.Surface](https://github.com/substance/surface))
- A plugin system for customized content types ([Substance.Nodes](https://github.com/substance/nodes))


We are collaborating with Open Access publishers and have implemented a new way to display scientific content, [eLife Lens](http://www.elifesciences.org/lens/). This tool is built on top of the Substance technology stack and has been successfully integrated by [eLife](http://lens.elifesciences.org/#00311/figures/text_224/image_fig1) and [Landes Bioscience](https://www.landesbioscience.com/article/25402/full_text/#load/figures/text-25/image-fig-F6). We think that health-related publishing in general could also benefit from such a set of tools. We are also collaborating with the teams at [Fiduswriter](http://fiduswriter.org) and [Hypothes.is](http://hypothes.is), since our projects share many ideas.


With the help of this grant, we would be able to put dedicated effort into the following components, preparing them for use by health communities:

- An easy-to-use editor for community health workers, doctors, scientists, journalists, educators and students
- An open document format for capturing health-related information, such as reports or scientific articles
- Support for legacy systems by providing interfaces for large-scale data import and export (e.g. [HealthData.Gov](http://www.healthdata.gov))
- Integration of [eLife Lens](http://lens.elifesciences.org), a novel way of viewing content on digital devices
- Collaborative features (multiple parties will be able to work on the same document)
- A robust storage interface, which gives you full control of data storage (store data locally, on a server or in a peer-to-peer fashion).

We are very interested in collaborations where our toolset can improve existing workflows of health organizations, increase the exchange of information, and foster an environment for innovations.


# Describe your project in one sentence

Substance provides an extensive, customizable content creation and annotation framework that enables user-centric interfaces and automatic data processing via your web-browser, creating the ideal environment for an Open Health Information Knowledgebase that journalists, scientists and even patients can contribute to.


# Who is the audience for this project? How does it meet their needs? (2 sentences)

In the initial phase of the project we address the needs of the primary contributors to health-related literature: journalists, scientists, and scientific publishers. 
Substance provides a browser-based editor, an underlying data model that simplifies the process of content creation, reviewing and publishing, and a mechanism for collaboration, document versioning and data exchange.


# What does success look like? (2 sentences)

Our goal will be achieved when authors, publishers, and consumers have a functioning browser-based reader and editor that is tailored to the needs of the health-publishing community. Consumers will have a working version (e.g., as a Chrome application) that can be used for reading and writing offline, as well.
